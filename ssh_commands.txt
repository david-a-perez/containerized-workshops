This file contains commands to (manually) connect to a container on chameleon cloud via SSH. 
This is one approach I found that works - let me know if you are able to replicate it.
I will look into generating code to automate this process and can integrate it with the backend.

# Inside chameleon VM (assumes docker is already installed)
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

docker run -it -p 2222:22 ubuntu

# Inside ubuntu container
mkdir ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
echo {PUBLIC_KEY} >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

apt-get update
apt-get install -y ssh
service ssh start

# On local machine
nano ~/.ssh/container_ssh.pem (add {PRIVATE_KEY} here)
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/container_ssh.pem
ssh -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/container_ssh.pem root@{WORKER_3_IP}
